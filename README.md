# Project 1 : Cover Letter Assistance

Required packages: 
1) NLTK
2) Re

The NLTK project takes text from job postings and distills the phrases with "action verbs."
For example, if a job has a paragraph with a sentence saying, "the ideal candidate will create insightful reports from deep analysis and research," the program will
collect the phrase "will create insightful reports from deep analysis and research." This will help applicants match phrases in their cover letter and resume to improve
chances of the application passing the screening programs.
